1. The first take away I had was the amount of research you have to do on your own. I feel like google and stackoverflow is my second home already!

2. The second thing I took from the past couple of sessions is the importance of asking for help when you get stuck on something. My classmates or "coworkers" are always happy to help!

Strategies:
1. Create a set schedule and stick to it! Studies show that people are happier when they have a routine they stick to every day.

2. Stay in a positive mindset while doing the course when things get difficult. Try to remember what waits for you on the other side!
